## Goals

There are two goals with this tutorial:

1. Introduce the participants to [ultrack package](https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack) and its capabilities.
2. Show that there are other ways of segmentating and tracking cells rather than training by annotating thousands of cells and applying deep learning models. Pre-trained models and classical algorithms are our friends and can be used to solve many problems.

## Instructors

The instructors for this workshop are:
- Jord√£o Bragantini
- Teun A.P.M. Huijben

## Pre-tutorial setup

Because this is a short tutorial (30 minutes), please [download this
repository](https://github.com/royerlab/ultrack-i2k2024) and [setup the programming environment](installation) before the tutorial starts.
