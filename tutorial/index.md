# Ultrack I2K 2024 Tutorial

# TODO: review this
This tutorial is aimed at folks who have some experience in scientific
computing with Python, but are new to image analysis. To get the most out of
it, they should have done some work with NumPy arrays — no need to be an
expert! — but they don't need to know an image from a pipe. We will cover the
fundamentals of working with images in scientific Python. The tutorial will be
split into four parts, of about 45 minutes each, plus breaks.

Use the sidebar to navigate to the materials.

## Instructors

The instructors for this workshop are
- Jordão Bragantini
- Teun A.P.M. Huijben

## Goals

The aim of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to bioimage analysis
with Python, scikit-image and napari. By the end of the tutorial attendees
will leave understanding how to work with images in Python, knowing some of the
main libraries that can help them do that, and knowing where to get more help
if they need it.
